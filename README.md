Introduction To Web Programming

1 - Back to Basics:
  _> What technologies RUN in a browser ?
    HTML - CSS - JAVASCRIPT
    - that's it! everything else is a variation on this.
  _> HTML
    HyperText Markup Language
    identifies elements of the web page:
    Header  Paragraph
    Footer  List
    Article  Links
    Section  Images
    Aside    Headings
    it does not dictate how the page looks!
  
  _> CSS
    Cascading Style Sheets
    Dictates how the page looks:
      Colors  Fonts 
      Spacing   Layout ...
    if it's pretty, it's probably CSS!
  
  _> JAVASCRIPT
    Dictates how the page interacts:
    Things that move.
    Things that change color.
    Things that change size. 
    Things that appear or disappear.
    Calculations
    if it's "interactive", it's probably JavaScript!
  
  BUT WHAT ABOUT:
    Bootstrap: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT
    Responsive Design: HTML, CSS
    Wordpress: HTML, CSS, JS, and a database server.
    jQuery, React, Angulat, Vue: Javascript
